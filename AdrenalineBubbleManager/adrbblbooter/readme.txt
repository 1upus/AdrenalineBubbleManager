1)

To enable adrenaline bubble booter, copy 'adrbblbooter' folder to your PSVita storage root :

ux0:/adrbblbooter

2)

Add 'adrbblbooter.suprx' first in line before 'adrenaline.suprx' under *TITLEID in HENkaku config :
Will use NPXX00001 as an example of the PSP bubble in livearea:

*NPXX00001
ux0:adrbblbooter/adrbblbooter.suprx
ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.suprx

If you want to disable adrenaline startdat image,
add 'adrbblbooter_nostartdat.suprx' instead of 'adrbblbooter.suprx'
first in line before 'adrenaline.suprx' in HENkaku config :

*NPXX00001
ux0:adrbblbooter/adrbblbooter_nostartdat.suprx
ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.suprx

After that Reload taiHen config.txt from molecularShell.

3)

Go to 'ux0:adrbblbooter/bubblesdb' folder, and create a text file and
name it with any PSP Bubble TITLEID you want to make it boot (ISO\CSO\PBP\PSOne) file :

ux0:adrbblbooter/bubblesdb/NPXX00001.txt

Open the created file 'NPXX00001.txt' in notepad and add the full path to
the ISO\CSO\PBP\PSOne game into it ( must be a ms0: path, not ux0:pspemu
also you can change\update the path any-time) :

ms0:/PSP/GAME/FILER/EBOOT.PBP

Note: This line means in PSVita side as ( ux0:pspemu/PSP/GAME/FILER/EBOOT.PBP )

That's it, do these steps ( #2, #3 ) for each PSP bubble you want to auto\direct boot it.

If you want to remove bubble auto\direct boot for specific game,
just delete the text file which containing it's titleid name:

ux0:adrbblbooter/bubblesdb/NPXX00001.txt

====================================================================================================

Additional Infos:

To load a custom startdat boot image for each PSP bubbles: 
Copy PNG image file to 'ux0:adrbblbooter/bubblesdb' folder, then rename it
to any PSP bubbles title-id you want to make it display the startdat boot image.
The image size and format must be 480x272 PNG file, otherwise it will not work.
If the PNG image file doesn't exist, then it will display the default Adrenaline logo.
Also in this version, you can display any logo without booting games if you delete
the title-id.txt file from bubblesdb folder, an example of PNG file is located in bubblesdb folder.

To use MARCH33 driver, just append MARCH33 in a new line under the game's file path, so it will look like this:
 
ms0:/ISO/GAME.ISO
MARCH33

To execute BOOT.BIN or EBOOT.OLD for prometheus, just append EBOOT.OLD or BOOT.BIN in a new line under under
the driver mode option, so will look like this:

ms0:/ISO/GAME.ISO
MARCH33
EBOOT.OLD

To use default options, just add the game's file path to the PSP bubble title-id.txt file, just like
the previous versions:

ms0:/ISO/GAME.ISO

Enjoy :)
